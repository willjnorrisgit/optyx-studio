# Optyx Studio

Landing page for Optyx Studio — a premium web design agency building
conversion-focused websites for businesses that already know how to
advertise.

Plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, deploy-ready for GitHub Pages.

## Structure

```
index.html          Page markup
css/styles.css       All styling
js/main.js           Mobile nav, scroll reveals, contact form handling
assets/favicon.svg   Logo mark used as the browser favicon
```

## Local development

No build step required — open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve
the folder locally:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Push to the `main` branch.
2. In the repo's **Settings → Pages**, set the source to `Deploy from a
   branch`, branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`.
3. The site will be published at `https://<username>.github.io/optyx-studio/`.

## Known placeholders

The following are placeholder content and should be replaced with real
material before launch:

- **Case study screenshot** — `.screenshot-placeholder` in the "Work"
  section. Replace with an `<img>` of the real LockOn site.
- **Case study results** — bracketed metrics in the case study section.
- **Testimonials** — quotes and attribution in the "Why us" section.
- **Awards / credibility badges** — placeholder badges in the "Why us"
  section.
- **Contact form** — currently shows a message on submit instead of
  sending anywhere. Wire it up to a form backend (e.g. Formspree, Netlify
  Forms) via the `contactForm` element in `index.html` / `js/main.js`.
- **Contact email** — `hello@optyxstudio.com` is a placeholder address.
